    title: "Why a Gearbox Rebuild Is Worth It?",
    desc: `A failing gearbox can cause major driving problems, from slipping gears and loud grinding to total transmission failure. Ignoring these issues not only makes driving unsafe but also risks damaging other components of your vehicle. A gearbox rebuild is a cost-effective solution that tackles the root cause of the problem. Instead of patching up issues, we restore the gearbox to near-new conditionâ€”ensuring smoother performance, better reliability, and an extended lifespan. For drivers experiencing ongoing gearbox trouble, a rebuild is often smarter and more affordable than repeated repairs or full replacement.`,
