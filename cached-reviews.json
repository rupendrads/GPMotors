I brought it to the nearest repair shop, GP Motors, and although they were fully booked, they understood my situation and kindly squeezed me into their tight schedule. They quickly diagnosed the problem and fixed the car perfectly. I’m truly grateful for their professionalism and excellent service!",

          "text": "Extremely poor service – not trustworthy\n\nI’ve taken my car to this garage for a full service and MOT two years in a row, expecting a thorough check and honest communication. Unfortunately, my experience has been deeply disappointing.\n\nFirstly, I asked for a new screw to be inserted into my tyre — this was not done, and no explanation was given.\n\nSecondly, the main reason I brought the car in was because warning lights were showing on the dashboard and the car had previously broken down. Just one week after the full service and MOT, my car broke down again, and I had to call AA Breakdown for help. Clearly, the issue was not resolved or even properly diagnosed during the service.\n\nLater, I discovered that my battery was extremely old and needed urgent replacement. This should have been an obvious thing to flag during a full service — but I was never told. What exactly was checked, then? Apart from possibly changing the oil, it feels like nothing else was done.\n\nI paid for a full service and MOT, but I’m left wondering what I actually paid for. This was a waste of time and money, and I no longer trust this garage with my vehicle.",
