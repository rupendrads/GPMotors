      question: "What Is Car MOT Service?",
      answer: "MOT is the abbreviation of the 'Ministry of Transport.' This test was designed in 1960. The foremost purpose of this test is to ensure that certain parts of the cars are okay and the car is roadworthy. If there is any damage or defects in those parts, the vehicle will fail the MOT test."
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      question: "Is Full Service Same as MOT?", 
      answer: "A full service similar to MOT. Like MOT in full-service, tyre tread depth, seat belt, engine, steering and many other parts are checked. If some need replacement, they will also be replaced to improve your car's efficiency, life and performance."
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      question: "Is It Okay to Drive a Car Without an MOT?",
      answer: "No, it is not legal to drive a car without a valid MOT certificate (except when driving to a pre-booked MOT test). You could face a fine of up to Â£1,000 for driving without an MOT, and your insurance may be invalid."
    },
    {
      id: 4,
      question: "Do You Get 14 Days of Grace for an MOT?",
      answer: "No, there is no grace period for MOT. Your MOT certificate expires at 11:59 PM on the expiry date. However, you can have your MOT done up to one month before it expires without losing any time on your new certificate."
    },
    {
      id: 5,
      question: "What Happens If I Miss My MOT Date?",
      answer: "If you miss your MOT expiry date, you cannot legally drive your car except to a pre-booked MOT test at an approved test center. You should book an MOT test as soon as possible and avoid driving until you have a valid certificate."
    },
    {
      id: 6,
      question: "Do I Need a Full Tank of Petrol for MOT?",
      answer: "No, you don't need a full tank of petrol for an MOT test. However, you should have enough fuel to allow the tester to run the engine and complete all necessary checks, including the emissions test. A quarter tank is usually sufficient."
